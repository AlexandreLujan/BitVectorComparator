# BitVectorComparator
-Simple circuit to check if two bit vectors are equal. Written in VHDL.<br />
-OUTPUT must be 1 when A == B.<br />

## Built With
-Quartus Prime Version 20.1.1 Build 720 11/11/2020 SJ Lite Edition<br />
(Copyright (C) 2020 Intel Corporation. All rights reserved).

## Simulation
-Simulation result using ModelSim-Altera contained in Quartus.<br />
-Note: This project uses a testbench to simulate the circuit. The testbench was implemented at the top of the circuit hierarchy.<br />
